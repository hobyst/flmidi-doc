# FL Studio MIDI API Reference Inline Documentation
 Inline Python documentation for the FL Studio MIDI API.

This repository includes 11 Python scripts (one per API module) with all the functions and methods described in the official
documentation for the [FL Studio MIDI API](https://www.image-line.com/support/flstudio_online_betamanual/html/midi_scripting.htm) introduced in the 20.7 update, as well as inline comments for all of them.

If you're using a code editor with Python support like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, add these scripts to 
your workspace. The software will index all the functions and methods and enable code completion. Start writting the name of a function or method and it will display all the possible matches as well as their descriptions as written in the API documentation.
